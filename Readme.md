Hi! This is the repo of Federico Denni's evil lair, a place where he can post all about his deranged ideas, projects, inspirations and essays that nobody ask about, but still.

Inspired by the digital garden principle, this repo is connected to an Obsidian vault stored locally on Federico monster linux machine. As it is also a learning occasion, to improve some basic HTML, CSS and Javascript skill, the objective is to make it from scratch and not use the fantastic frameworks of Quartz or Jekyll or Hugo. Why? Essentially because he is a moron.

Let's talk some features that this website would need to have:

- ‚ú® a custom dithering filter image ‚ú®: both for aesthetic and for making the site less heavy. The keyword is lightness and sustainability. (System Fonts!)
- üñ®Ô∏è crazy interface: it would be cool to implement crazy interfaces and design inspired by early internet goofiness. Still with the objective to make a light website. (No external libraries!)
- üìÑ markdown/mdx conversion in html: Obsidian is used as a back-repo, so mdx is difficult to integrate (need to search for some plugins), but the opportunity of having live-pieces of code hosted on the website to show some experimentation could be very cool
- Comments, easy-to-navigate, seo-friendly, XML? XML

Things to do:
- [ ] Define the interface on Figma (make a note in content)
	- [ ] logo, colors, style
	- [ ] translate styles and variables as CSS (need to find a way to make CSS bearable)
- [ ] Study how to slug the Obsidian notes and transform them in HTML
- [ ] Integrate python script for dithering (make a note in content)
- [ ] Finish index.html
	- [ ] integrate Figma wireframe
	- [ ] Define `<head>` and necessary SEO

For the immediate future this is enough, although more is needed in the future.
